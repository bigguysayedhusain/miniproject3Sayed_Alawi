# Mini Project 3

## Description

The project involves developing a website dedicated to movie reviews. Built with Flask and styled using Bootstrap, the 
site allows users to register and manage their accounts. Once registered, users can write new movie reviews, edit their 
existing ones, or delete them if desired. To enhance the cinematic experience, the website sports a blackish color theme
, giving it a look and feel reminiscent of a dark cinema environment.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
The application will use a SQLite database to store users and movie reviews. Python comes with built-in support for 
SQLite in the sqlite3 module. To initiate the database, run the below command:

```
flask --app flaskr init-db
```

### Install requirements with pip

```
pip install -r requirments.txt
```

### Executing program

```
flask --app flaskr run
```
